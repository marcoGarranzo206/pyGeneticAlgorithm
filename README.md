Genetic algorithms (GA) for discrete and continuous functions in python

In this repository I code from scratch genetic algorithms in python and provide a few use cases. Any suggestions for improving the algorithm or optimizating the procedure or ideas for use cases are appreciated. At the moment it is just a side project but I am always looking to improve my work.
