    "# Using GA for feature selection\n",

    "\n",
    "* Improve model performance by alleviating the curse of dimensionality and reducing overfitting\n",
    "* Reduce the cost of data acquisition. In genomics research, we can probe the entire human genome for some biomedical application, such as classifying cancer patients based on their genome. If we can reduce the number of genes probed (from the entirety of the human genome to a few hundred) we can reduce the costs of data acquisition.\n",
    "* Reduce data storage and shorter processing times: even if the data acquisition is the same after feature selection, we can still benefit from feature selection by reducing storage costs and processing power.\n",
    "* Model simplification and better interpretability: I would rather interpret a 10 variable model than a 100 variable model, how about you?"

I downloaded the csv filed which was called php8tg99.csv and renamed it to arcene_data.csv. There are 200 data points and 10000 variables in the data. We split the data 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test\n",

    "In order to find the feature subset which generalizes best to unseen data, we split the remaining training data into train and validation, and calculate our fitness w.r.t to validation. To avoid fitting the variable selection to one subset of the data, we split training and validation at every model evaluation.\n",
